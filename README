============
SPADLIB V0.2
============

Required

  QuickLisp https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/
  FriCAS    http://fricas.sourceforge.net/ 
  
Install  

  $ cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
  $ git clone https://github.com/nilqed/spadlib.git
  
  Note: Add/merge the contents of spadlib/system-index.txt to 
  local-projects/system-index.txt (or only those you like), so that
  quicklisp can find the ASDF files. This is not necessary if the
  packages are moved to 'local-project/<item>', i.e without the 'spadlib'
  folder.  
  
		  
Usage

  Add the following function to your .fricas.input:
  
  quickLoad(s:String):Void ==
    syscmd(s) ==> systemCommand(s)$MoreSystemCommands
    lisp2(f,a) ==> syscmd string(FORMAT('NIL,"lisp (~A _"~A_")",f,a)$Lisp)
    lisp2("load", "~/quicklisp/setup")
    lisp2("ql:quickload",s)

  Then
  
  () -> quickLoad "packageName"
  
  Note: if "quickLoad" is unknown after FriCAS start, you have to enter
        ")frame next" under certain circumstances (depends on start parameters).
        
        
  
Create a package

  $ fripac.sh "packageName" 
  
  type fripac.sh -h for more options.


---
NOTES 

Before creating a new package, check if "packageName" is not  already in use:
  Either by  )lisp (ql:system-apropos "packageName") or
  by  
      quickLoad "quicklsp"
	  qlApropos "packageName".
	  
  Also notice the name "quicklsp", because "quicklisp" is already taken,
  of course.
  
After a package has been loaded by "quickLoad", the following functions are
available in the Lisp "BOOT" package, i.e. in FriCAS:

  compile_packageName()$Lisp
  load_packageName()$Lisp 
  test_packageName()$Lisp
 
where "packageName" is the name of the package (case insensitive), for 
instance "compile_pipe()$Lisp" will recompile the package "pipe". 
 
These functions may be used to recompile/reload the package if necessary
(e.g after FriCAS upgrades or package updates).
