AffinePoint

An affine point is a point in an affine space, which is a geometric structure 
that generalizes some properties of Euclidean spaces without relying on 
concepts of distance or angles, focusing instead on parallelism and ratios of 
lengths. In this context, points can be translated using vectors, but there is 
no fixed origin.

AffineSimplex

An affine simplex is a generalization of a geometric simplex to any dimension, 
defined as the convex hull of a set of affinely independent points. It retains 
the properties of simplices, such as having faces that are also simplices of 
lower dimensions.

AffineChain

An affine chain refers to a collection of oriented affine simplexes in a given 
space, which can be used in mathematical contexts such as integration and 
topology. It involves the concept of affine transformations that preserve 
certain geometric properties
