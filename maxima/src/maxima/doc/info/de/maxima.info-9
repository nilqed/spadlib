75.1 Functions and Variables for to_poly_solve
==============================================

The packages 'to_poly' and 'to_poly_solve' are experimental; the
specifications of the functions in these packages might change or the
some of the functions in these packages might be merged into other
Maxima functions.

Barton Willis (Professor of Mathematics, University of Nebraska at
Kearney) wrote the 'to_poly' and 'to_poly_solve' packages and the
English language user documentation for these packages.

 -- Operator: %and

     The operator '%and' is a simplifying nonshort-circuited logical
     conjunction.  Maxima simplifies an '%and' expression to either
     true, false, or a logically equivalent, but simplified, expression.
     The operator '%and' is associative, commutative, and idempotent.
     Thus when '%and' returns a noun form, the arguments of '%and' form
     a non-redundant sorted list; for example

          (%i1) a %and (a %and b);
          (%o1)                       a %and b

     If one argument to a conjunction is the explicit the negation of
     another argument, '%and' returns false:

          (%i2) a %and (not a);
          (%o2)                         false

     If any member of the conjunction is false, the conjunction
     simplifies to false even if other members are manifestly
     non-boolean; for example

          (%i3) 42 %and false;
          (%o3)                         false

     Any argument of an '%and' expression that is an inequation (that
     is, an inequality or equation), is simplified using the Fourier
     elimination package.  The Fourier elimination simplifier has a
     pre-processor that converts some, but not all, nonlinear
     inequations into linear inequations; for example the Fourier
     elimination code simplifies 'abs(x) + 1 > 0' to true, so

          (%i4) (x < 1) %and (abs(x) + 1 > 0);
          (%o4)                         x < 1

     Notes
        * The option variable 'prederror' does not alter the
          simplification '%and' expressions.

        * To avoid operator precedence errors, compound expressions
          involving the operators '%and, %or', and 'not' should be fully
          parenthesized.

        * The Maxima operators 'and' and 'or' are both short-circuited.
          Thus 'and' isn't associative or commutative.

     Limitations The conjunction '%and' simplifies inequations locally,
     not globally.  This means that conjunctions such as

          (%i5) (x < 1) %and (x > 1);
          (%o5)                 (x > 1) %and (x < 1)

     do not simplify to false.  Also, the Fourier elimination code
     ignores the fact database;

          (%i6) assume(x > 5);
          (%o6)                        [x > 5]
          (%i7) (x > 1) %and (x > 2);
          (%o7)                 (x > 1) %and (x > 2)

     Finally, nonlinear inequations that aren't easily converted into an
     equivalent linear inequation aren't simplified.

     There is no support for distributing '%and' over '%or'; neither is
     there support for distributing a logical negation over '%and'.

     Related functions '%or, %if, and, or, not'

     Status The operator '%and' is experimental; the specifications of
     this function might change and its functionality might be merged
     into other Maxima functions.

 -- Operator: %if (<bool>, <a>, <b>)

     The operator '%if' is a simplifying conditional.  The conditional
     <bool> should be boolean-valued.  When the conditional is true,
     return the second argument; when the conditional is false, return
     the third; in all other cases, return a noun form.

     Maxima inequations (either an inequality or an equality) are not
     boolean-valued; for example, Maxima does not simplify 5 < 6 to
     true, and it does not simplify 5 = 6 to false; however, in the
     context of a conditional to an '%if' statement, Maxima
     automatically attempts to determine the truth value of an
     inequation.  Examples:

          (%i1) f : %if(x # 1, 2, 8);
          (%o1)                 %if(x - 1 # 0, 2, 8)
          (%i2) [subst(x = -1,f), subst(x=1,f)];
          (%o2)                        [2, 8]

     If the conditional involves an inequation, Maxima simplifies it
     using the Fourier elimination package.

     Notes

        * If the conditional is manifestly non-boolean, Maxima returns a
          noun form:

          (%i3) %if(42,1,2);
          (%o3)                     %if(42, 1, 2)

        * The Maxima operator 'if' is nary, the operator '%if' isn't
          nary.

     Limitations The Fourier elimination code only simplifies nonlinear
     inequations that are readily convertible to an equivalent linear
     inequation.

     To use: 'load(to_poly_solve)'

     Status: The operator '%if' is experimental; its specifications
     might change and its functionality might be merged into other
     Maxima functions.

 -- Operator: %or

     The operator '%or' is a simplifying nonshort-circuited logical
     disjunction.  Maxima simplifies an '%or' expression to either true,
     false, or a logically equivalent, but simplified, expression.  The
     operator '%or' is associative, commutative, and idempotent.  Thus
     when '%or' returns a noun form, the arguments of '%or' form a
     non-redundant sorted list; for example

          (%i1) a %or (a %or b);
          (%o1)                        a %or b

     If one member of the disjunction is the explicit the negation of
     another member, '%or' returns true:

          (%i2) a %or (not a);
          (%o2)                         true

     If any member of the disjunction is true, the disjunction
     simplifies to true even if other members of the disjunction are
     manifestly non-boolean; for example

          (%i3) 42 %or true;
          (%o3)                         true

     Any argument of an '%or' expression that is an inequation (that is,
     an inequality or equation), is simplified using the Fourier
     elimination package.  The Fourier elimination code simplifies
     'abs(x) + 1 > 0' to true, so we have

          (%i4) (x < 1) %or (abs(x) + 1 > 0);
          (%o4)                         true

     Notes
        * The option variable 'prederror' does not alter the
          simplification of '%or' expressions.

        * You should parenthesize compound expressions involving the
          operators '%and, %or', and 'not'; the binding powers of these
          operators might not match your expectations.

        * The Maxima operators 'and' and 'or' are both short-circuited.
          Thus 'or' isn't associative or commutative.

     Limitations The conjunction '%or' simplifies inequations locally,
     not globally.  This means that conjunctions such as

          (%i1) (x < 1) %or (x >= 1);
          (%o1) (x > 1) %or (x >= 1)

     do not simplify to true.  Further, the Fourier elimination code
     ignores the fact database;

          (%i2) assume(x > 5);
          (%o2)                        [x > 5]
          (%i3) (x > 1) %and (x > 2);
          (%o3)                 (x > 1) %and (x > 2)

     Finally, nonlinear inequations that aren't easily converted into an
     equivalent linear inequation aren't simplified.

     The algorithm that looks for terms that cannot both be false is
     weak; also there is no support for distributing '%or' over '%and';
     neither is there support for distributing a logical negation over
     '%or'.

     Status The operator '%or' is experimental; the specifications of
     this function might change and its functionality might be merged
     into other Maxima functions.

 -- Function: complex_number_p (<x>)

     The predicate 'complex_number_p' returns true if its argument is
     either 'a + %i * b', 'a', '%i b', or '%i', where 'a' and 'b' are
     either rational or floating point numbers (including big floating
     point); for all other inputs, 'complex_number_p' returns false; for
     example

          (%i1) map('complex_number_p,[2/3, 2 + 1.5 * %i, %i]);
          (%o1)                  [true, true, true]
          (%i2) complex_number_p((2+%i)/(5-%i));
          (%o2)                         false
          (%i3) complex_number_p(cos(5 - 2 * %i));
          (%o3)                         false

     Status The operator 'complex_number_p' is experimental; its
     specifications might change and its functionality might be merged
     into other Maxima functions.

 -- Function: compose_functions (<l>)

     The function call 'compose_functions(l)' returns a lambda form that
     is the composition of the functions in the list <l>.  The functions
     are applied from right to left; for example

          (%i1) compose_functions([cos, exp]);
                                                  %g151
          (%o1)             lambda([%g151], cos(%e     ))
          (%i2) %(x);
                                            x
          (%o2)                       cos(%e )

     When the function list is empty, return the identity function:

          (%i3) compose_functions([]);
          (%o3)                lambda([%g152], %g152)
          (%i4)  %(x);
          (%o4)                           x

     Notes
        * When Maxima determines that a list member isn't a symbol or a
          lambda form, 'funmake' (not 'compose_functions') signals an
          error:

          (%i5) compose_functions([a < b]);

          funmake: first argument must be a symbol, subscripted symbol,
          string, or lambda expression; found: a < b
          #0: compose_functions(l=[a < b])(to_poly_solve.mac line 40)
           -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);

        * To avoid name conflicts, the independent variable is
          determined by the function 'new_variable'.

               (%i6) compose_functions([%g0]);
               (%o6)              lambda([%g154], %g0(%g154))
               (%i7) compose_functions([%g0]);
               (%o7)              lambda([%g155], %g0(%g155))

          Although the independent variables are different, Maxima is
          able to to deduce that these lambda forms are semantically
          equal:

               (%i8) is(equal(%o6,%o7));
               (%o8)                         true

     Status The function 'compose_functions' is experimental; its
     specifications might change and its functionality might be merged
     into other Maxima functions.

 -- Function: dfloat (<x>)

     The function 'dfloat' is a similar to 'float', but the function
     'dfloat' applies 'rectform' when 'float' fails to evaluate to an
     IEEE double floating point number; thus

          (%i1) float(4.5^(1 + %i));
                                         %i + 1
          (%o1)                       4.5
          (%i2) dfloat(4.5^(1 + %i));
          (%o2)        4.48998802962884 %i + .3000124893895671

     Notes

        * The rectangular form of an expression might be poorly suited
          for numerical evaluation-for example, the rectangular form
          might needlessly involve the difference of floating point
          numbers (subtractive cancellation).

        * The identifier 'float' is both an option variable (default
          value false) and a function name.

     To use 'load(to_poly_solve)'

     Status The function 'dfloat' is experimental; its specifications
     might change and its functionality might be merged into other
     Maxima functions.

 -- Function: elim (<l>, <x>)

     The function 'elim' eliminates the variables in the set or list 'x'
     from the equations in the set or list 'l'.  Each member of 'x' must
     be a symbol; the members of 'l' can either be equations, or
     expressions that are assumed to equal zero.

     The function 'elim' returns a list of two lists; the first is the
     list of expressions with the variables eliminated; the second is
     the list of pivots; thus, the second list is a list of expressions
     that 'elim' used to eliminate the variables.

     Here is a example of eliminating between linear equations:

          (%i1) elim(set(x + y + z = 1, x - y  - z = 8, x - z = 1),
                     set(x,y));
          (%o1)            [[2 z - 7], [y + 7, z - x + 1]]

     Eliminating 'x' and 'y' yields the single equation '2 z - 7 = 0';
     the equations 'y + 7 = 0' and 'z - z + 1 = 1' were used as pivots.
     Eliminating all three variables from these equations,
     triangularizes the linear system:

          (%i2) elim(set(x + y + z = 1, x - y  - z = 8, x - z = 1),
                     set(x,y,z));
          (%o2)           [[], [2 z - 7, y + 7, z - x + 1]]

     Of course, the equations needn't be linear:

          (%i3) elim(set(x^2 - 2 * y^3 = 1,  x - y = 5), [x,y]);
                               3    2
          (%o3)       [[], [2 y  - y  - 10 y - 24, y - x + 5]]

     The user doesn't control the order the variables are eliminated.
     Instead, the algorithm uses a heuristic to attempt to choose the
     best pivot and the best elimination order.

     Notes

        * Unlike the related function 'eliminate', the function 'elim'
          does not invoke 'solve' when the number of equations equals
          the number of variables.

        * The function 'elim' works by applying resultants; the option
          variable 'resultant' determines which algorithm Maxima uses.
          Using 'sqfr', Maxima factors each resultant and suppresses
          multiple zeros.

        * The 'elim' will triangularize a nonlinear set of polynomial
          equations; the solution set of the triangularized set can be
          larger than that solution set of the untriangularized set.
          Thus, the triangularized equations can have spurious
          solutions.

 -- Function: fourier_elim ([<eq1>, <eq2>, ...], [<var1>, <var>, ...])

     Fourier elimination is the analog of Gauss elimination for linear
     inequations (equations or inequalities).  The function call
     'fourier_elim([eq1, eq2, ...], [var1, var2, ...]' does Fourier
     elimination on a list of linear inequations '[eq1, eq2, ...]' with
     respect to the variables '[var1, var2, ...]'; for example

          (%i1) fourier_elim([y-x < 5, x - y < 7, 10 < y],[x,y]);
          (%o1)            [y - 5 < x, x < y + 7, 10 < y]
          (%i2) fourier_elim([y-x < 5, x - y < 7, 10 < y],[y,x]);
          (%o2)        [max(10, x - 7) < y, y < x + 5, 5 < x]

     Eliminating first with respect to x and second with respect to y
     yields lower and upper bounds for x that depend on y, and lower and
     upper bounds for y that are numbers.  Eliminating in the other
     order gives x dependent lower and upper bounds for y, and numerical
     lower and upper bounds for x.

     When necessary, 'fourier_elim' returns a _disjunction_ of lists of
     inequations:

          (%i3) fourier_elim([x # 6],[x]);
          (%o3)                  [x < 6] or [6 < x]

     When the solution set is empty, 'fourier_elim' returns 'emptyset',
     and when the solution set is all reals, 'fourier_elim' returns
     'universalset'; for example

          (%i4) fourier_elim([x < 1, x > 1],[x]);
          (%o4)                       emptyset

          (%o5)                     universalset

     For nonlinear inequations, 'fourier_elim' returns a (somewhat)
     simplified list of inequations:

          (%i6) fourier_elim([x^3 - 1 > 0],[x]);
                         2                             2
          (%o6) [1 < x, x  + x + 1 > 0] or [x < 1, - (x  + x + 1) > 0]
          (%i7) fourier_elim([cos(x) < 1/2],[x]);
          (%o7)                  [1 - 2 cos(x) > 0]

     Instead of a list of inequations, the first argument to
     'fourier_elim' may be a logical disjunction or conjunction:

          (%i8) fourier_elim((x + y < 5) and (x - y >8),[x,y]);
                                                        3
          (%o8)            [y + 8 < x, x < 5 - y, y < - -]
                                                        2
          (%i9) fourier_elim(((x + y < 5) and x < 1) or  (x - y >8),[x,y]);
          (%o9)          [y + 8 < x] or [x < min(1, 5 - y)]

     The function 'fourier_elim' supports the inequation operators '<,
     <=, >, >=, #', and '='.

     The Fourier elimination code has a preprocessor that converts some
     nonlinear inequations that involve the absolute value, minimum, and
     maximum functions into linear in equations.  Additionally, the
     preprocessor handles some expressions that are the product or
     quotient of linear terms:

          (%i10) fourier_elim([max(x,y) > 6, x # 8, abs(y-1) > 12],[x,y]);
          (%o10) [6 < x, x < 8, y < - 11] or [8 < x, y < - 11]
           or [x < 8, 13 < y] or [x = y, 13 < y] or [8 < x, x < y, 13 < y]
           or [y < x, 13 < y]
          (%i11) fourier_elim([(x+6)/(x-9) <= 6],[x]);
          (%o11)           [x = 12] or [12 < x] or [x < 9]

 -- Function: isreal_p (<e>)

     The predicate 'isreal_p' returns true when Maxima is able to
     determine that 'e' is real-valued on the entire real line; it
     returns false when Maxima is able to determine that 'e' isn't
     real-valued on some nonempty subset of the real line; and it
     returns a noun form for all other cases.

          (%i1) map('isreal_p, [-1, 0, %i, %pi]);
          (%o1)               [true, true, false, true]

     Maxima variables are assumed to be real; thus

          (%i2) isreal_p(x);
          (%o2)                         true

     The function 'isreal_p' examines the fact database:

          (%o4)                      isreal_p(z)

     Limitations Too often, 'isreal_p' returns a noun form when it
     should be able to return false; a simple example: the logarithm
     function isn't real-valued on the entire real line, so
     'isreal_p(log(x))' should return false; however

          (%i5) isreal_p(log(x));

 -- Function: new_variable (type)

     Return a unique symbol of the form '%[z,n,r,c,g]k', where 'k' is an
     integer.  The allowed values for type are integer, natural_number,
     real, natural_number, and general.  (By natural number, we mean the
     nonnegative integers; thus zero is a natural number.  Some, but not
     all,definitions of natural number exclude zero.)

     When type isn't one of the allowed values, type defaults to
     general.  For integers, natural numbers, and complex numbers,
     Maxima automatically appends this information to the fact database.

          (%i1) map('new_variable,

 -- Function: parg (<x>)

     The function 'parg' is a simplifying version of the complex
     argument function 'carg'; thus

          (%i1) map('parg,[1,1+%i,%i, -1 + %i, -1]);

                                   4    2     4

     Generally, for a non-constant input, 'parg' returns a noun form;
     thus

          (%i2) parg(x + %i * sqrt(x));
          (%o2)                 parg(x + %i sqrt(x))

     When 'sign' can determine that the input is a positive or negative
     real number, 'parg' will return a non-noun form for a non-constant
     input.  Here are two examples:

          (%i3) parg(abs(x));
          (%o3) 0
          (%i4) parg(-x^2-1);
          (%o4)                          %pi

     Note The 'sign' function mostly ignores the variables that are
     declared to be complex ('declare(x,complex)'); for variables that
     are declared to be complex, the 'parg' can return incorrect values;
     for example

          (%i1) declare(x,complex)$

 -- Function: simp_inequality (<e>)

     The function 'simp_inequality' applies some simplifications to

          (%o1) (x>1) %and (x<1)

     And second, 'simp_inequality' doesn't consult the fact database:

 -- Function: subst_parallel (<l>, <e>)

     When 'l' is a single equation or a list of equations, substitute
     the right hand side of each equation for the left hand side.  The
     substitutions are made in parallel; for example

          (%i1) load(to_poly_solve)$

          (%i2) subst_parallel([x=y,y=x], [x,y]);
          (%o2)                        [y, x]

     Compare this to substitutions made serially:

          (%i3) subst([x=y,y=x],[x,y]);
          (%o3)                        [x, x]

     The function 'subst_parallel' is similar to 'sublis' except that
     'subst_parallel' allows for substitution of nonatoms; for example

          (%i4) subst_parallel([x^2 = a, y = b], x^2 * y);
          (%o4)                          a b
          (%i5) sublis([x^2 = a, y = b], x^2 * y);

                                                                       2
          sublis: left-hand side of equation must be a symbol; found: x
           -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);

     The substitutions made by 'subst_parallel' are literal, not
     semantic; thus 'subst_parallel' does not recognize that x * y is a
     subexpression of x^2 * y

          (%i6) subst_parallel([x * y = a], x^2 * y);
                                         2
          (%o6)                         x  y

     The function 'subst_parallel' completes all substitutions before
     simplifications.  This allows for substitutions into conditional
     expressions where errors might occur if the simplifications were
     made earlier:

          (%i7) subst_parallel([x = 0], %if(x < 1, 5, log(x)));
          (%o7)                           5
          (%i8) subst([x = 0], %if(x < 1, 5, log(x)));

          log: encountered log(0).

 -- Function: to_poly (<e>, <l>)

     The function 'to_poly' attempts to convert the equation 'e' into a
     polynomial system along with inequality constraints; the solutions
     to the polynomial system that satisfy the constraints are solutions
     to the equation 'e'.  Informally, 'to_poly' attempts to
     polynomialize the equation <e>; an example might clarify:

          (%i1) load(to_poly_solve)$

          (%i2) to_poly(sqrt(x) = 3, [x]);
                                      2
          (%o2) [[%g130 - 3, x = %g130 ],
                                %pi                               %pi
                             [- --- < parg(%g130), parg(%g130) <= ---], []]
                                 2                                 2

     The conditions '-%pi/2<parg(%g130),parg(%g130)<=%pi/2' tell us that
     '%g130' is in the range of the square root function.  When this is
     true, the solution set to 'sqrt(x) = 3' is the same as the solution
     set to '%g130-3,x=%g130^2'.

     To polynomialize trigonometric expressions, it is necessary to
     introduce a non algebraic substitution; these non algebraic
     substitutions are returned in the third list returned by 'to_poly';
     for example

          (%i3) to_poly(cos(x),[x]);
                          2                                 %i x
          (%o3)    [[%g131  + 1], [2 %g131 # 0], [%g131 = %e    ]]

     Constant terms aren't polynomializied unless the number one is a
     member of the variable list; for example

          (%i4) to_poly(x = sqrt(5),[x]);
          (%o4)                [[x - sqrt(5)], [], []]
          (%i5) to_poly(x = sqrt(5),[1,x]);

                                %pi                               %pi
                             [- --- < parg(%g132), parg(%g132) <= ---], []]
                                 2                                 2

     To generate a polynomial with sqrt(5) + sqrt(7) as one of its
     roots, use the commands

          (%i6) first(elim_allbut(first(to_poly(x = sqrt(5) + sqrt(7),
                                                [1,x])), [x]));

 -- Function: to_poly_solve (<e>, <l>, [options])

     The function 'to_poly_solve' tries to solve the equations e for the
     variables l.  The equation(s) e can either be a single expression
     or a set or list of expressions; similarly, l can either be a
     single symbol or a list of set of symbols.  When a member of e
     isn't explicitly an equation, for example x^2 -1, the solver
     asummes that the expression vanishes.

     The basic strategy of 'to_poly_solve' is use 'to_poly' to convert
     the input into a polynomial form and call 'algsys' on the
     polynomial system.  Thus user options that affect 'algsys',
     especially 'algexact', also affect 'to_poly_solve'.  The default
     for 'algexact' is false, but for 'to_poly_solve', generally
     'algexact' should be true.  The function 'to_poly_solve' does not
     locally set 'algexact' to true because this would make it
     impossible to find approximate solutions when the 'algsys' is
     unable to determine an exact solution.

     When 'to_poly_solve' is able to determine the solution set, each
     member of the solution set is a list in a '%union' object:

          (%i1) load(to_poly_solve)$

          (%i2) to_poly_solve(x*(x-1) = 0, x);
          (%o2)               %union([x = 0], [x = 1])

     When 'to_poly_solve' is unable to determine the solution set, a
     '%solve' nounform is returned (in this case, a warning is printed)

          (%i3) to_poly_solve(x^k + 2* x + 1 = 0, x);

     Subsitution into a '%solve' nounform can sometimes result in the
     solution

          (%i4) subst(k = 2, %);
          (%o4)                   %union([x = - 1])

     Especially for trigonometric equations, the solver sometimes needs
     to introduce an arbitary integer.  These arbitary integers have the
     form '%zXXX', where 'XXX' is an integer; for example

          (%i5) to_poly_solve(sin(x) = 0, x);
          (%o5)   %union([x = 2 %pi %z33 + %pi], [x = 2 %pi %z35])

     To re-index these variables to zero, use 'nicedummies':

          (%i6) nicedummies(%);
          (%o6)    %union([x = 2 %pi %z0 + %pi], [x = 2 %pi %z1])

     Occasionally, the solver introduces an arbitary complex number of
     the form '%cXXX' or an arbitary real number of the form '%rXXX'.
     The function 'nicedummies' will re-index these identifiers to zero.

     The solution set sometimes involves simplifing versions of various
     of logical operators including '%and', '%or', or '%if' for
     conjunction, disjuntion, and implication, respectively; for example

          (%i7) sol : to_poly_solve(abs(x) = a, x);
          (%o7) %union(%if(isnonnegative_p(a), [x = - a], %union()),
                                %if(isnonnegative_p(a), [x = a], %union()))
          (%i8) subst(a = 42, sol);
          (%o8)             %union([x = - 42], [x = 42])
          (%i9) subst(a = -42, sol);
          (%o9)                       %union()

     The empty set is represented by '%union'.

     The function 'to_poly_solve' is able to solve some, but not all,
     equations involving rational powers, some nonrational powers,
     absolute values, trigonometric functions, and minimum and maximum.
     Also, some it can solve some equations that are solvable in in
     terms of the Lambert W function; some examples:

          (%i1) load(to_poly_solve)$

          (%i2) to_poly_solve(set(max(x,y) = 5, x+y = 2), set(x,y));
          (%o2)      %union([x = - 3, y = 5], [x = 5, y = - 3])
          (%i3) to_poly_solve(abs(1-abs(1-x)) = 10,x);
          (%o3)             %union([x = - 10], [x = 12])
          (%i4) to_poly_solve(set(sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) = 5, x + y = 10),
                              set(x,y));
                               3/2               3/2
                              5    %i - 10      5    %i + 10
          (%o4) %union([x = - ------------, y = ------------],
                                   2                 2

                                         5    %i + 10        5    %i - 10
                                    [x = ------------, y = - ------------])
                                              2                   2
          (%i5) to_poly_solve(cos(x) * sin(x) = 1/2,x,
                              'simpfuncs = ['expand, 'nicedummies]);
                                                   %pi
          (%o5)              %union([x = %pi %z0 + ---])
                                                    4
          (%i6) to_poly_solve(x^(2*a) + x^a + 1,x);
                                                  2 %i %pi %z81

                                            1/a         a
                            (sqrt(3) %i - 1)    %e
          (%o6) %union([x = -----------------------------------],
                                            1/a
                                           2
                                                            2 %i %pi %z83
                                                            -------------
                                                      1/a         a
                                    (- sqrt(3) %i - 1)    %e
                               [x = -------------------------------------])
                                                     1/a
                                                    2
          (%i7) to_poly_solve(x * exp(x) = a, x);
          (%o7)              %union([x = lambert_w(a)])

     For linear inequalities, 'to_poly_solve' automatically does Fourier
     elimination:

          (%i8) to_poly_solve([x + y < 1, x - y >= 8], [x,y]);
                                         7
          (%o8) %union([x = y + 8, y < - -],
                                         2
                                                                        7
                                           [y + 8 < x, x < 1 - y, y < - -])
                                                                        2

     Each optional argument to 'to_poly_solve' must be an equation;
     generally, the order of these options does not matter.

        * 'simpfuncs = l', where 'l' is a list of functions.  Apply the
          composition of the members of l to each solution.

               (%i1) to_poly_solve(x^2=%i,x);
                                              1/4             1/4
               (%o1)       %union([x = - (- 1)   ], [x = (- 1)   ])
               (%i2) to_poly_solve(x^2= %i,x, 'simpfuncs = ['rectform]);
                                     %i         1             %i         1
               (%o2) %union([x = - ------- - -------], [x = ------- + -------])
                                   sqrt(2)   sqrt(2)        sqrt(2)   sqrt(2)

          Sometimes additional simplification can revert a
          simplification; for example

               (%i3) to_poly_solve(x^2=1,x);
               (%o3)              %union([x = - 1], [x = 1])
               (%i4) to_poly_solve(x^2= 1,x, 'simpfuncs = [polarform]);
                                                       %i %pi
               (%o4)            %union([x = 1], [x = %e      ]

          Maxima doesn't try to check that each member of the function
          list 'l' is purely a simplification; thus

               (%i5) to_poly_solve(x^2 = %i,x, 'simpfuncs = [lambda([s],s^2)]);
               (%o5)                   %union([x = %i])

          To convert each solution to a double float, use 'simpfunc =
          ['dfloat]':

               (%i6) to_poly_solve(x^3 +x + 1 = 0,x,
                                   'simpfuncs = ['dfloat]), algexact : true;
               (%o6) %union([x = - .6823278038280178],
               [x = .3411639019140089 - 1.161541399997251 %i],
               [x = 1.161541399997251 %i + .3411639019140089])

        * 'use_grobner = true' With this option, the function
          'poly_reduced_grobner' is applied to the equations before
          attempting their solution.  Primarily, this option provides a
          workaround for weakness in the function 'algsys'.  Here is an
          example of such a workaround:

               (%i7) to_poly_solve([x^2+y^2=2^2,(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=2^2],[x,y],
                                   'use_grobner = true);
                                   sqrt(7) - 1      sqrt(7) + 1
               (%o7) %union([x = - -----------, y = -----------],
                                        2                2
                                                sqrt(7) + 1        sqrt(7) - 1
                                           [x = -----------, y = - -----------])
                                                     2                  2
               (%i8) to_poly_solve([x^2+y^2=2^2,(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=2^2],[x,y]);
               (%o8)                       %union()

        * 'maxdepth = k', where 'k' is a positive integer.  This
          function controls the maximum recursion depth for the solver.
          The default value for 'maxdepth' is five.  When the recursions
          depth is exceeded, the solver signals an error:

               (%i9) to_poly_solve(cos(x) = x,x, 'maxdepth = 2);

               Unable to solve
               Unable to solve
               (%o9)        %solve([cos(x) = x], [x], maxdepth = 2)

        * 'parameters = l', where 'l' is a list of symbols.  The solver
          attempts to return a solution that is valid for all members of
          the list 'l'; for example:

               (%i10) to_poly_solve(a * x = x, x);
               (%o10)                   %union([x = 0])
               (%i11) to_poly_solve(a * x = x, x, 'parameters = [a]);
               (%o11) %union(%if(a - 1 = 0, [x = %c111], %union()),
                                              %if(a - 1 # 0, [x = 0], %union()))

          In '(%o2)', the solver introduced a dummy variable; to
          re-index the these dummy variables, use the function
          'nicedummies':

               (%i12) nicedummies(%);
               (%o12) %union(%if(a - 1 = 0, [x = %c0], %union()),
                                              %if(a - 1 # 0, [x = 0], %union()))

     The 'to_poly_solve' uses data stored in the hashed array
     'one_to_one_reduce' to solve equations of the form f(a) = f(b).
     The assignment 'one_to_one_reduce['f,'f] : lambda([a,b], a=b)'
     tells 'to_poly_solve' that the solution set of f(a) = f(b) equals
     the solution set of a=b; for example

          (%i13) one_to_one_reduce['f,'f] : lambda([a,b], a=b)$

          (%i14) to_poly_solve(f(x^2-1) = f(0),x);
          (%o14)             %union([x = - 1], [x = 1])

     More generally, the assignment 'one_to_one_reduce['f,'g] :
     lambda([a,b], w(a, b) = 0' tells 'to_poly_solve' that the solution
     set of f(a) = f(b) equals the solution set of w(a,b) = 0; for
     example

          (%i15) one_to_one_reduce['f,'g] : lambda([a,b], a = 1 + b/2)$

          (%i16) to_poly_solve(f(x) - g(x),x);
          (%o16)                   %union([x = 2])

     Additionally, the function 'to_poly_solve' uses data stored in the
     hashed array 'function_inverse' to solve equations of the form f(a)
     = b.  The assignment 'function_inverse['f] : lambda([s], g(s))'
     informs 'to_poly_solve' that the solution set to 'f(x) = b' equals
     the solution set to 'x = g(b)'; two examples:

          (%i17) function_inverse['Q] : lambda([s], P(s))$

          (%i18) to_poly_solve(Q(x-1) = 2009,x);
          (%o18)              %union([x = P(2009) + 1])
          (%i19) function_inverse['G] : lambda([s], s+new_variable(integer));
          (%o19)       lambda([s], s + new_variable(integer))
          (%i20) to_poly_solve(G(x - a) = b,x);
          (%o20)             %union([x = b + a + %z125])

     Notes

        * The solve variables needn't be symbols; when 'fullratsubst' is
          able to appropriately make substitutions, the solve variables
          can be nonsymbols:

          (%i1) to_poly_solve([x^2 + y^2 + x * y = 5, x * y = 8],
                              [x^2 + y^2, x * y]);
                                            2    2
          (%o1)           %union([x y = 8, y  + x  = - 3])

        * For equations that involve complex conjugates, the solver
          automatically appends the conjugate equations; for example

          (%i1) declare(x,complex)$

          (%i2) to_poly_solve(x + (5 + %i) * conjugate(x) = 1, x);
                                             %i + 21
          (%o2)              %union([x = - -----------])
                                           25 %i - 125
          (%i3) declare(y,complex)$

          (%i4) to_poly_solve(set(conjugate(x) - y = 42 + %i,
                                  x + conjugate(y) = 0), set(x,y));
                                     %i - 42        %i + 42
          (%o4)        %union([x = - -------, y = - -------])
                                        2              2

        * For an equation that involves the absolute value function, the
          'to_poly_solve' consults the fact database to decide if the
          argument to the absolute value is complex valued.  When

               (%i1) to_poly_solve(abs(x) = 6, x);
               (%o1)              %union([x = - 6], [x = 6])
               (%i2) declare(z,complex)$

               (%i3) to_poly_solve(abs(z) = 6, z);
               (%o3) %union(%if((%c11 # 0) %and (%c11 conjugate(%c11) - 36 =
                                                      0), [z = %c11], %union()))

          This is the only situation that the solver consults the fact
          database.  If a solve variable is declared to be an integer,
          for example, 'to_poly_solve' ignores this declaration.

76.1 Introduction to Units
==========================

The _unit_ package enables the user to convert between arbitrary units
and work with dimensions in equations.  The functioning of this package
is radically different from the original Maxima units package - whereas
the original was a basic list of definitions, this package uses rulesets
to allow the user to chose, on a per dimension basis, what unit final
answers should be rendered in.  It will separate units instead of
intermixing them in the display, allowing the user to readily identify
the units associated with a particular answer.  It will allow a user to
simplify an expression to its fundamental Base Units, as well as
providing fine control over simplifying to derived units.  Dimensional
analysis is possible, and a variety of tools are available to manage
conversion and simplification options.  In addition to customizable
automatic conversion, _units_ also provides a traditional manual
conversion option.

Note - when unit conversions are inexact Maxima will make approximations
resulting in fractions.  This is a consequence of the techniques used to
simplify units.  The messages warning of this type of substitution are
disabled by default in the case of units (normally they are on) since
this situation occurs frequently and the warnings clutter the output.
(The existing state of ratprint is restored after unit conversions, so
user changes to that setting will be preserved otherwise.)  If the user
needs this information for units, they can set _unitverbose:on_ to
reactivate the printing of warnings from the unit conversion process.

_unit_ is included in Maxima in the share/contrib/unit directory.  It
obeys normal Maxima package loading conventions:

     Done.

The WARNING messages are expected and not a cause for concern - they
indicate the _unit_ package is redefining functions already defined in
Maxima proper.  This is necessary in order to properly handle units.
The user should be aware that if other changes have been made to these
functions by other packages those changes will be overwritten by this
loading process.

The _unit.mac_ file also loads a lisp file _unit-functions.lisp_ which
contains the lisp functions needed for the package.

Clifford Yapp is the primary author.  He has received valuable
assistance from Barton Willis of the University of Nebraska at Kearney
(UNK), Robert Dodier, and other intrepid folk of the Maxima mailing
list.

There are probably lots of bugs.  Let me know.  'float' and 'numer'
don't do what is expected.

TODO : dimension functionality, handling of temperature, showabbr and
friends.  Show examples with addition of quantities containing units.

76.2 Functions and Variables for Units
======================================

 -- Function: setunits (<list>)

     By default, the _unit_ package does not use any derived dimensions,
     but will convert all units to the seven fundamental dimensions
     using MKS units.

          (%i2) N;
                                               kg m
          (%o2)                                ----
                                                 2
                                                s
          (%i3) dyn;
                                             1      kg m
          (%o3)                           (------) (----)
                                           100000     2
                                                     s
          (%i4) g;
                                              1
          (%o4)                             (----) (kg)
                                             1000
          (%i5) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127        kg m
          (%o5)                       (-------------) (----)
                                       1800000000000     2
                                                        s

     In some cases this is the desired behavior.  If the user wishes to
     use other units, this is achieved with the 'setunits' command:

          (%i6) setunits([centigram,inch,minute]);
          (%o6)                                done
          (%i7) N;
                                      1800000000000   %in cg
          (%o7)                      (-------------) (------)
                                           127            2
                                                      %min
          (%i8) dyn;
                                         18000000   %in cg
          (%o8)                         (--------) (------)
                                           127          2
                                                    %min
          (%i9) g;
          (%o9)                             (100) (cg)
          (%i10) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                              %in cg
          (%o10)                              ------
                                                  2
                                              %min

     The setting of units is quite flexible.  For example, if we want to
     get back to kilograms, meters, and seconds as defaults for those
     dimensions we can do:

          (%i11) setunits([kg,m,s]);
          (%o11)                               done
          (%i12) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127        kg m
          (%o12)                      (-------------) (----)
                                       1800000000000     2
                                                        s

     Derived units are also handled by this command:

          (%i17) setunits(N);
          (%o17)                               done
          (%i18) N;
          (%o18)                                 N
          (%i19) dyn;
                                              1
          (%o19)                           (------) (N)
                                            100000
          (%i20) kg*m/s^2;
          (%o20)                                 N
          (%i21) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                              127
          (%o21)                        (-------------) (N)
                                         1800000000000

     Notice that the _unit_ package recognized the non MKS combination
     of mass, length, and inverse time squared as a force, and converted
     it to Newtons.  This is how Maxima works in general.  If, for
     example, we prefer dyne to Newtons, we simply do the following:

          (%i22) setunits(dyn);
          (%o22)                               done
          (%i23) kg*m/s^2;
          (%o23)                          (100000) (dyn)
          (%i24) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127
          (%o24)                         (--------) (dyn)
                                          18000000

     To discontinue simplifying to any force, we use the uforget
     command:

          (%i26) uforget(dyn);
          (%o26)                               false
          (%i27) kg*m/s^2;
                                               kg m
          (%o27)                               ----
                                                 2
                                                s
          (%i28) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127        kg m
          (%o28)                      (-------------) (----)
                                       1800000000000     2
                                                        s

     This would have worked equally well with 'uforget(N)' or
     'uforget(%force)'.

     See also 'uforget'.  To use this function write first
     'load("unit")'.

 -- Function: uforget (<list>)

     By default, the _unit_ package converts all units to the seven
     fundamental dimensions using MKS units.  This behavior can be
     changed with the 'setunits' command.  After that, the user can
     restore the default behavior for a particular dimension by means of
     the 'uforget' command:

          (%i13) setunits([centigram,inch,minute]);
          (%o13)                               done
          (%i14) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                              %in cg
          (%o14)                              ------
                                                  2
                                              %min
          (%i15) uforget([cg,%in,%min]);
          (%o15)                      [false, false, false]
          (%i16) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127        kg m
          (%o16)                      (-------------) (----)
                                       1800000000000     2
                                                        s

     'uforget' operates on dimensions, not units, so any unit of a
     particular dimension will work.  The dimension itself is also a
     legal argument.

     See also 'setunits'.  To use this function write first
     'load("unit")'.

 -- Function: convert (<expr>, <list>)

     When resetting the global environment is overkill, there is the
     'convert' command, which allows one time conversions.  It can
     accept either a single argument or a list of units to use in
     conversion.  When a convert operation is done, the normal global
     evaluation system is bypassed, in order to avoid the desired result
     being converted again.  As a consequence, for inexact calculations
     "rat" warnings will be visible if the global environment
     controlling this behavior ('ratprint') is true.  This is also
     useful for spot-checking the accuracy of a global conversion.
     Another feature is 'convert' will allow a user to do Base Dimension
     conversions even if the global environment is set to simplify to a
     Derived Dimension.

          (%i2) kg*m/s^2;

     See also 'setunits' and 'uforget'.  To use this function write
     first 'load("unit")'.

 -- Optional variable: usersetunits
     Default value: none

     If a user wishes to have a default unit behavior other than that
     described, they can make use of _maxima-init.mac_ and the
     _usersetunits_ variable.  The _unit_ package will check on startup
     to see if this variable has been assigned a list.  If it has, it
     will use setunits on that list and take the units from that list to
     be defaults.  'uforget' will revert to the behavior defined by
     usersetunits over its own defaults.  For example, if we have a
     _maxima-init.mac_ file containing:

          usersetunits : [N,J];

     we would see the following behavior:

          (%i1) load("unit")$

     Without 'usersetunits', the initial inputs would have been
     converted to MKS, and uforget would have resulted in a return to
     MKS rules.  Instead, the user preferences are respected in both
     cases.  Notice these can still be overridden if desired.  To
     completely eliminate this simplification - i.e.  to have the user
     defaults reset to factory defaults - the 'dontusedimension' command
     can be used.  'uforget' can restore user settings again, but only
     if 'usedimension' frees it for use.  Alternately,
     'kill(usersetunits)' will completely remove all knowledge of the
     user defaults from the session.  Here are some examples of how
     these various options work.

     Unfortunately this wide variety of options is a little confusing at
     first, but once the user grows used to them they should find they
     have very full control over their working environment.

 -- Function: metricexpandall (<x>)

     Rebuilds global unit lists automatically creating all desired
     metric units.  <x> is a numerical argument which is used to specify
     how many metric prefixes the user wishes defined.  The arguments
     are as follows, with each higher number defining all lower numbers'
     units:

                     0 - none. Only base units
                     1 - kilo, centi, milli
          (default)  2 - giga, mega, kilo, hecto, deka, deci, centi, milli,
                         micro, nano
                     3 - peta, tera, giga, mega, kilo, hecto, deka, deci,
                         centi, milli, micro, nano, pico, femto
                     4 - all

     Normally, Maxima will not define the full expansion since this
     results in a very large number of units, but 'metricexpandall' can
     be used to rebuild the list in a more or less complete fashion.
     The relevant variable in the _unit.mac_ file is <%unitexpand>.

 -- Variable: %unitexpand
     Default value: '2'

     This is the value supplied to 'metricexpandall' during the initial
     loading of _unit_.

77.1 Introduction to zeilberger
===============================

'zeilberger' is an implementation of Zeilberger's algorithm for definite
hypergeometric summation, and also Gosper's algorithm for indefinite
hypergeometric summation.  'zeilberger' makes use of the "filtering"
optimization method developed by Axel Riese.  'zeilberger' was developed
by Fabrizio Caruso.  'load(zeilberger)' loads this package.

77.1.1 The indefinite summation problem
---------------------------------------

'zeilberger' implements Gosper's algorithm for indefinite hypergeometric
summation.  Given a hypergeometric term F_k in k we want to find its
hypergeometric anti-difference, that is, a hypergeometric term f_k such
that F_k = f_(k+1) - f_k.

77.1.2 The definite summation problem
-------------------------------------

'zeilberger' implements Zeilberger's algorithm for definite
hypergeometric summation.  Given a proper hypergeometric term (in n and
k)

F_(n,k) and a positive integer d we want to find a d-th order linear
recurrence with polynomial coefficients (in n) for F_(n,k) and a
rational function R in n and k such that

a_0 F_(n,k) + ... + a_d F_(n+d),k = Delta_k(R(n,k) F_(n,k)),

where Delta_k is the k-forward difference operator, i.e., Delta_k(t_k)
:= t_(k+1) - t_k.

77.1.3 Verbosity levels
-----------------------

There are also verbose versions of the commands which are called by
adding one of the following prefixes:

'Summary'
     Just a summary at the end is shown
'Verbose'
     Some information in the intermidiate steps
'VeryVerbose'
     More information
'Extra'
     Even more information including information on the linear system in
     Zeilberger's algorithm

For example:
'GosperVerbose', 'parGosperVeryVerbose', 'ZeilbergerExtra',
'AntiDifferenceSummary'.

77.2 Functions and Variables for zeilberger
===========================================

 -- Function: AntiDifference (F_k, <k>)

     Returns the hypergeometric anti-difference of F_k, if it exists.

     Otherwise 'AntiDifference' returns 'no_hyp_antidifference'.

 -- Function: Gosper (F_k, <k>)

     Returns the rational certificate R(k) for F_k, that is, a rational
     function such that F_k = R(k+1) F_(k+1) - R(k) F_k, if it exists.
     Otherwise, 'Gosper' returns 'no_hyp_sol'.

 -- Function: GosperSum (<F_k>, <k>, <a>, <b>)

     Returns the summmation of F_k from <k> = <a> to <k> = <b> if F_k
     has a hypergeometric anti-difference.  Otherwise, 'GosperSum'
     returns 'nongosper_summable'.

 -- Function: parGosper (<F_(n,k)>, <k>, <n>, <d>)

     Attempts to find a <d>-th order recurrence for F_(n,k).

     The algorithm yields a sequence [s_1, s_2, ..., s_m] of solutions.
     Each solution has the form

     [R(n, k), [a_0, a_1, ..., a_d]].

     'parGosper' returns '[]' if it fails to find a recurrence.

 -- Function: Zeilberger (<F_(n,k)>, <k>, <n>)

     Attempts to compute the indefinite hypergeometric summation of
     F_(n,k).

     'Zeilberger' first invokes 'Gosper', and if that fails to find a
     solution, then invokes 'parGosper' with order 1, 2, 3, ..., up to
     'MAX_ORD'.  If Zeilberger finds a solution before reaching
     'MAX_ORD', it stops and returns the solution.

     The algorithms yields a sequence [s_1, s_2, ..., s_m] of solutions.
     Each solution has the form

     [R(n,k), [a_0, a_1, ..., a_d]].

     'Zeilberger' returns '[]' if it fails to find a solution.

     'Zeilberger' invokes 'Gosper' only if 'Gosper_in_Zeilberger' is
     'true'.

77.3 General global variables
=============================

 -- Global variable: MAX_ORD
     Default value: 5

     'MAX_ORD' is the maximum recurrence order attempted by
     'Zeilberger'.

 -- Global variable: simplified_output
     Default value: 'false'

     When 'simplified_output' is 'true', functions in the 'zeilberger'
     package attempt further simplification of the solution.

 -- Global variable: linear_solver
     Default value: 'linsolve'

     'linear_solver' names the solver which is used to solve the system
     of equations in Zeilberger's algorithm.

 -- Global variable: warnings
     Default value: 'true'

     When 'warnings' is 'true', functions in the 'zeilberger' package
     print warning messages during execution.

 -- Global variable: Gosper_in_Zeilberger
     Default value: 'true'

     When 'Gosper_in_Zeilberger' is 'true', the 'Zeilberger' function
     calls 'Gosper' before calling 'parGosper'.  Otherwise, 'Zeilberger'
     goes immediately to 'parGosper'.

 -- Global variable: trivial_solutions
     Default value: 'true'

     When 'trivial_solutions' is 'true', 'Zeilberger' returns solutions
     which have certificate equal to zero, or all coefficients equal to
     zero.

77.4 Variables related to the modular test
==========================================

 -- Global variable: mod_test
     Default value: 'false'

     When 'mod_test' is 'true', 'parGosper' executes a modular test for
     discarding systems with no solutions.

 -- Global variable: modular_linear_solver
     Default value: 'linsolve'

     'modular_linear_solver' names the linear solver used by the modular
     test in 'parGosper'.

 -- Global variable: ev_point
     Default value: 'big_primes[10]'

     'ev_point' is the value at which the variable <n> is evaluated when
     executing the modular test in 'parGosper'.

 -- Global variable: mod_big_prime
     Default value: 'big_primes[1]'

     'mod_big_prime' is the modulus used by the modular test in
     'parGosper'.

 -- Global variable: mod_threshold
     Default value: 4

     'mod_threshold' is the greatest order for which the modular test in
     'parGosper' is attempted.

78 Glossar
**********

Das Glossar stellt den deutschen bersetzungen die englischen Begriffe
gegenber und erlutert die Begriffe.

_Ausdruck - expression_
     Jede beliebige Zeichenfolge, die Maxima als Eingabe versteht und
     die von Maxima verarbeitet werden kann.

_Aussage - predicate_
     Ausdrcke, die zu den booleschen Werten 'true' oder 'false'
     auswerten.

_Aussagefunktion - predicate function_

_Auswertung - evaluation_
     Ausdrcke werden zunchst ausgewertet.  Funktionen werden
     aufgerufen, die Werte von Variablen werden eingesetzt.  Die
     Auswertung wird von der Vereinfachung (Simplification)
     unterschieden und wird vor der Vereinfachung ausgefhrt.

_Begrenzungszeichen - delimiter_
     Das Zeichen das auf der linken und rechten Seite zum Beispiel eine
     Liste '[ ... ]' begrenzt.

_Bezeichner - identifier_
     Der Name einer Variablen oder Funktion.

_Eigenschaft - property_

_Expansion - expansion_
     Mathematische Ausdrcke werden ausmultipliziert.

_Dateiausgabe - file output_

_Dateieingabe - file input_

_Dreiecksmatrix - triangular matrix_

_Fehlersuche - debugging_

_Flag - flag_
     Boolesche Variablen mit den Werten 'true' oder 'false', die zur
     Steuerung des Programms vom Nutzer gesetzt werden knnen.

_Koeffizientenmatrix, erweitert - augmented coefficient matrix_
     Die erweiterte Koeffizientenmatrix entsteht, wenn an die
     Koeffizientenmatrix eines Gleichungssystems eine Spalte mit der
     rechten Seite des Gleichungssystems angefgt wird.

_Kommandozeile - command line_

_Konsole Ein- und Ausgabe - console interaction_

_Marke - label_
     Die Eingaben und Ausgaben werden von Maxima in globale Variablen,
     die als Marken bezeichnet werden, mit den Namen '%i' und '%o' sowie
     '%t' fr Zwischenergebnisse abgelegt.  Die Marken werden
     fortlaufend numeriert.

_Matrix, schwachbesetzt - sparse matrix_

_Musterargument - pattern argument_

_Mustervariable - pattern variable_
     Mustervariable werden mit der Funktion 'matchdeclare' definiert.
     Mustervariable werden bei der Definition von Mustern verwendet.
     Den Mustervariablen werden bei Erkennung eines Musters die
     Teilausdrcke zugewiesen, fr die eine bereinstimmung vorliegt.
     Von den Mustervariablen sind die Musterargumente zu unterscheiden.

_Optionsvariable - option variable_

_Muster - pattern_

_Musterabgleich - pattern matching_

_N-ary-Operator - n-ary operator_
     Ein N-ary-Operator kann ein beliebige Anzahl an Operanden haben.
     Beispiele fr N-Ary-Operatoren sind die Addition '+' und die
     Multiplikation '*'.

_Pipe - pipe_
     Eine Pipe (englisch fr Rohr, Rhre) bezeichnet einen gepufferten
     uni- oder bidirektionalen Datenstrom zwischen zwei Prozessen nach
     dem FIFO (First In - First Out)-Prinzip.

_Programmfehler - bug_

_Prompt - prompt_
     Kann auch als Eingabeaufforderung bersetzt werden.

_Regelpaket - rule package_

_Schlsselwort - keyword_

_Sitzungsverwaltung - session management_

_Stammfunktion - antiderivative_

_Standardwert - default value_

_Stufenmatrix - echelon matrix_

_Substantivform - noun form_
     Die Substantivform ist eine nicht ausgewerteter aber dennoch
     vereinfachter Ausdruck.

_Systemvariable - system variable_
     Systemvariablen enthalten von Maxima verwaltete globale Werte.
     Systemvariablen sollten vom Nutzer, auch wenn es mglich ist, nicht
     genutzt werden.

_Teilausdruck - subexpression_

_Token - token_
     Ein Token ist ein Stck Text, das die lexikalische Grundeinheit
     ist, die von einem Parser behandelt wird.

_Umgebung - enviroment_

_Verbform - verb form_
     Die Verbform wird zunchst ausgewertet und erst dann vereinfacht.

_Vereinfachung - simplification_
     Mathematischen Funktionen, algebraische Ausdrcke oder Gleichungen
     werden nach der Auswertung vereinfacht.  Ein Groteil dieser
     Vereinfachungen geschieht automatisch.  Fr weitere Vereinfachungen
     gibt es spezielle Funktionen und eine Vielzahl von Schaltern, mit
     denen gezielt bestimmte Ergebnisse erzielt werden knnen.

_Zeichenkette - string_

_Zwischenraumzeichen - whitespace_
     Zwischenraumzeichen ist eine Bezeichnung fr Zeichen in einem Text,
     die im Texteditor oder Textverarbeitungsprogramm nicht dargestellt
     werden und dennoch (Speicher-)Platz in Anspruch nehmen.  Sie dienen
     vorrangig dazu, Wrter oder Zeilen voneinander abzugrenzen.

_Wortart - part of speech_
     Beim Einlesen eines Ausdrucks prft der Parser, ob die Argumente
     eines Operators die korrekte Wortart haben.  Maxima kennt die
     Wortarten 'expr', 'clause' und 'any'.
